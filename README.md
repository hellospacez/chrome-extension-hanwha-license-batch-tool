# chrome-extension-hanwha-license-batch-tool
A Chrome extension designed to batch add licenses to Hanwha NVR recorders. Adding licenses one by one through the official interface can be slow and repetitive, so this tool provides an automated, efficient way to handle multiple licenses at once.


‚ú® Features

Reduces manual input time and errors

üí° Background
